# MapReducer-project2

Let the dataset in the link X which contains data from two sensors
mobile phones (accelerometer, gyroscope) and smart watches of 9 users. The data of
sensor data is in the form x, y, z, i.e. acceleration in each axis of motion for the phones and
smart watches separately. Both the creation time, the sensor time, and
the time of arrival of the data at the collection station. Based on the arrival time of the data at the
collection station, do the following with MapReduce (use the least number of passes
map-reduce passes that you can):

a. Calculate the average x, y, and z values of the accelerometer for each hour of the day per
user per month for phones and watches.

b. Calculate the standard deviation of the accelerometer's x, y, z for each hour of the day per
user per month for phones and watches.
